# README

This is a clone of <https://github.com/JLospinoso/ccc> that allows you work with the code in VS Code.

The cool stuff happens in the .vscode folder.

To use,

- Read this: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc#_prerequisites>

- Open the TLD "ccc", navigate to a file you want to run

- Create a build folder in the same directory as that file

- Hit F5
