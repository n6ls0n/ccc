# README

This is a clone of <https://github.com/JLospinoso/ccc> that allows you work with the code in VS Code.

The cool stuff happens in the .vscode folder.

To use,

- Read this: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc#_prerequisites> and complete steps 1 to 3 of the prerequisites

- Open the TLD "ccc", navigate to a file you want to run

- Create a build folder in the same directory as that file

- Hit F5

## Helpful Link

- Use this site (<https://www.learncpp.com/>) to get a different explanation on the same topic. Highly recommend finishing a chapter and coming here to go over the same material
